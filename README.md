A front-end YouTube clone project is a web application that mimics the interface and user experience of YouTube. It typically includes features like video playback, a video library, search functionality, user profiles, and responsive design. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and may leverage frameworks like React or Angular to handle the dynamic content and state management. The goal is to recreate the look and feel of YouTube's front-end, often as a practice project to improve web development skills.
